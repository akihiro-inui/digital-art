# digital-art

TBD: project abstraction

## Install tools

Before you start, you should install some tools to loanch this project.

### Yarn

```
brew install yarn
```

`npm` is also fine, but I recommend `yarn` because it is faster and more useful a little bit.

### Parcel

```
yarn global add parcel-bundler
```

I chose `parcel` instead of `webpack` bacause I wanted to avoid writing a complex config file.

### TypeScript

```
yarn global add typescript
```

## Set up this project

After installing above all, you should clone this project and install packages written in `package.json`.

```
git clone https://github.com/shunp/digital-art.git .
yarn
yarn start
```
